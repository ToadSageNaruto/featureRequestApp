For years we have used technology to allow us to grow, but more importantly to allow us to grow with our clients. So we must always be efficient with the time our clients have for us. Imagine where we utlized these new technologies to improve our correspondence with the client for a new feature they would like to see implemented. Well you don't have to imagine for long. I present to you the Feature Request App.

Notes
------
I used the tutorial "Creating a Single Page Todo App with Node and Angular" from sctotch.io (listed in the credits). The db connection is based off that tutorial and still utilizes it. I am not taking full credit for what the tutorial provided, I only built upon it. I am truly grateful for the help the tutorial provided and for allowing me to use it as a building block. With that in mind thank you for looking at it :)
